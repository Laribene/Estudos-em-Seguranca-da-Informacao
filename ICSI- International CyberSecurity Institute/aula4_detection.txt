IDS Concepts
- Pre-emptive blocking: prevent intrusions before they occur. It observe any danger signs of 
imminent threats and then blocking the user or IP address from which these signs 
originate. 
Disadvantage of this method type is because can block a legitimate user by mistake for example.(false positive)
A software alert the administrator that suspicious has taken place. A human administrator
choose if he blocks the suspicious adress or not. Doing it, you run the risk of blocking out legitimate users.
This is not the entire strategy.

- Anomaly Detection:
	- Trace back
Detect intrusion and then notify the administrator.
Any activity that does not match the pattern of normal user access is noted and logged.
The software compares observed activity against expected normal usage profiles. 
Profiles: developed for specific users, groups of users or applications.
	- Threshold Monitoring:
	Monitor acceptable behaviour levels and observer whether these levels are exceeed.
		-Failed login attempts
		- amount of data the user downloads.
		-monitoring the time a user is connected.
	High rate of false positive in which the system misidentifies normal usage
	as a attack
	
	- Resource Profiling:
	Measures the system-wide use of resources and develops a historic usage profile. 
	Looking at how a user normally utilizes system to identify usage that are outside normal parameters.
	It is difficult to interpreter the meaning too, because an increase in usage might indicate something 
	benign like an increased workflow rather than an attempt to breach security.

	- User/Group Work Profiling 
	IDS maintains individual work profiles about users and groups.
	These user and groups are expected to pbey these profiles. 
	There are short-term profiles: capture recent changing work patterns,
	long-term profiles: view of usage over an extended period of time.
	Difficults about the two profiles: Profiles that are defined too broadly, and too narrowly

	- Executable Profiling: Measure and monitor how programs use system resources, attention to whose activity
	cannot be traced to a specific originating user.
	Privileges of the user executing the software.
	The mothod notify the administrator, such as by network message or email.

-Components of an IDS:
	-activity: element of data source
	-administrator: security
	-Sensor: collects data and pass to the analysis
	- Analyser: analyses the data collected by the sensor
	-An alert: message of analyser 
	- Manager: used to manage, example console.
	-Notification: IDS manager makes the operator aware of an alert
	- Operator: often the administrator. 
	- An event: occurence indicates a suspicious activity may have occured.
	- Data source: raw information that the IDS uses to detect suspicious activity.

IPS: active IDS, Stop any traffic that is malicious. 
passive IDS, only detect. 
The problem with active IDS and IPS is the false positive
Single machine: HIDS and HIPS
Network segment: NIDS, NIPS

Types of IDS:
	Snort: Open source IDS. Installed on server. Works with Host-based firewall. 
	Three modes: Sniffer, packet logger, network intrusion-detection.

	Sniffer: The console(shell) display a continuos stream of the contents of all packets coming
	across that machine> Good way to check whether transmissions are encrypted.

	Packet Logger: Similar to sniffer mode. The difference is that the packet contents
	are written to a text file log rather than displayed in the console.

	Network Intrusion Detection:(NIDS)
	Snort uses a heuristic approach to detecting anomalous traffic. 
	Using the shell.
	Snort is good use in conjunction with host -based firewall or as an IDS  on each server to provide additional security.

	Cisco Intrusion Detection and Prevention:
	
Honeypots: 
simulate a server, to attract and probably identify intruders.
Everyone who try to connect to a honeypots machine is considered an intruder
 	- Specter: software honeypot solution.
		-logs all traffic to the server for analysis.
		- It has five modes: Open, Secure, Failing, Strange, Aggressive: trace the attacker and gain its identity
	
	- Symantec Decoy Server: Simulated a real server by simulating many server functions,
	such as incoming and outgoing e-mail traffic.
		- works as a honeypot and an IDS. 
		- It is used together with Symantec's antivirus software, firewall software and antispyware

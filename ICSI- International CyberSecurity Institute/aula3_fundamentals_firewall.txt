When you know the IP Adress:
- You can realize the IP spoofing


Types of Firewall:
- Packet filtering
	- basic type
	- incoming packet is examined
	- Usually, many operating systems include basic packet filtering
	- Do not offer any user authentication
	- See only the header and not the packet content.
	- Do not know the particular client 
	
- Application gateway(or application proxy)
	-Authentication and verification
	-Examine the client application and the server-side application to which it is trying to connect to.
	-Use a lot of system resources
	- suscetible to various flooding attacks, because the flooding attack may be the additional time it takes for an application to negotiate authenticating a request.
	- When the connection is established, packets are not checked.
	- Provide the user logon method to mitigate some attacks
	
	
	
- Circuit level gateway
	-More security than the apllication gateways
	-Implemented on high-end equipment.
	- Authentication the user is the first step.
	-More secure solution



- Stateful packet inspection
	- improvement of basic packet filtering
	-permit acess based on the examination of the current packet, and on data derived from previous packets in the conversation.
	- less susceptible to ping floods and SYN floods, because examines the source IP of all packets
	-most secure


Firewall Implementation:

Host Based
	-Installed on a machine with an operating system
	- Using that machine as your firewall
	- Need and hardened operating system. This means: Ensuring all patches are updated, Uninstalling unneeded application or utilities, Closing unused ports, Turning off all unused services.
	
Dual-homed host
	- Firewall running on a server with at least two network interfaces.
	-Server acts as a router between the network and the interfaces
	- Very cheap and depends on the operating system
	-require a separate subnet between the application gateway and the router.
	- There are physically two separate firewalls.
	
Router -based firewall
	- packet filtering
	- can be shipped preconfigured

Screened host
	-combination of firewalls, bastion host(might be an application gateway) + screening router(router packet) or vice versa.
	- Needs one network interface
	- does not require a separate subnet between the application gateway and the router.
	- less secure than dual-homed host
	- any security flaw or misconfiguration affects both firewalls.
	

Proxy Servers
	- Used with a firewall to hide the IP adress and to present a single IP address to the outside world.
	- Provide a cntrol mechanism, because it's log all outgoing traffic.
	-Runs as software on the same machine as your firewall.
	- 

Windows firewall:
	- If you not need a port, block it
	- Always block ICMP traffic, because of ping, tracert and so on.
	- Windows 10: Firewall enable the Inbound rule titled: "File and Printer Sharing(Echo Request - ICMPv4-In)"

Linux firewall:
	- Iptables: Tables, chains, and rules
	O iptables não é essencialmente um firewall, mas um programa que, por meio de seus módulos, possibilita ao usuário configurar o kernel Linux e o conjunto de regras do filtro de pacotes — função típica do firewall.
	- The tables contain chains of rules:
	Packet filtering: INPUT: incoming packets, OUTPUT: sent out chain processes traffic, FORWARD: chain applies to routed packets.
	Network address translation: Outbound traffic that initiates a new connection. Used if your machine serves as a gateway or proxy server.
	Packet alteration:alters or mangles packet.

-iptables -F
-iptables -N block
-iptables -A block -m state --state ESTABLISHED, RELATED -j ACCEPT

List current iptables rules:
-iptables -L

Allow communication on a specific port, SSH 22, or HTTP 80:
- iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -dport ssh -j ACCEPT
-iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -dport 80 -j ACCEPT

A: Append this rule to a rule chain
-L: LIst the current filter rules
-p The connection protocol used
--dport: The destionation port required for the rule. A single port can be given or a range.
-i: Only match if the packet is coming in on the specified interface.
-v: Verbose output
-s, --source: address source specification
-d, --destination: address destination specification
